Conventions
-----------

#. We write a requirement *shall* be met if it must be fulfilled.
   If the feature that implements a shall requirement is not in the final system,
   then the system does not meet this requirement.
   We write a requirment *should* be met if it is not critical
   to the system working, but is still desirable.
#. Text in bracket such as "[ ... ]" denotes informative text that is
   not part of the specification.
